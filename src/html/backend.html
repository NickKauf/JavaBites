        <h4>Metaphors for OOP</h4>

        <p style="font-size: 16px">When we learned about inheritance and composition in Java,
            we were given some simple analogies about animals, vehicles, and people.
            Recently I came across a thread of CS teachers discussing what analogies they use to
            teach object oriented programming to their students. Not surprisingly, several replies mentioned
            using humans, vehicles, or animals as an analogy for OOP concepts. There were also some analogies I
            hadn’t heard before, such as the parts of speech analogy where objects = nouns, methods = verbs,
            properties=adjectives and so forth.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px">
        The most interesting replies, however, were arguing why certain
            analogies— or even all analogies— were inappropriate to describe OOP. One commenter noted that they
            hate using “things” as an analogy for classes, which they believed should be understood better as
            abstractions of behavior. Another commenter argued that inheritance was too dominant in OOP analogies,
            which should focus on composition (they preferred the vehicle analogy). Several people noted that all
            analogies fall short of describing how actual classes behave in programming in terms of sending messages
            back and forth— but some conceded they preferred imagining parts or components that do something since
            it was, after all, the original philosophy behind OOP. As a beginner, I’m still not sure which analogy
            is leading me towards a better understanding of the possibilities of OOP, but I did find this
            meta-discussion helpful in its own way and a good reminder that an analogy can only go so far.

        <h4>How to Override Your Parents</h4>
        <small class="text-muted">July 23, 2021</small>

    <div class="card-body">
        <p style="font-size: 16px">"In any object-oriented programming language,
            Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation
            of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.
            A method in the child class, such as fly in the example below, does not need to be overridden
            because it does not exist in the parent class. However, the sleep method exists in the parent class
            but it does something different (in this case returns a different string).
            Since the sleep method exists in the parent class the sleep method is overridden using
            the annotation @Override.
            Override is not the same as overload."

            private String animalName;
